--using max(), date()

SELECT max(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order. 
--using order by

SELECT title

--using left join

SELECT
director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN  "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id=people.show_id
where titles.title='Bright Star'

#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made? 
--using order by, limit

SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'

LIMIT 1;

--using AND, min()
SELECT title, release_year

WHERE type = 'Movie'
AND release_year <= 
(SELECT MIN(release_year) 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie');
